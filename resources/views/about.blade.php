                                When the World Summits were first established, the notion was that just
thinking about ideas does not bring about change in society, but rather
speaking out about them and seeing them implemented did. Our conferences
provide our delegates with an unrivalled experience by using committees that
are extremely customised, engaging, and dynamic in nature.

<br><br>

The deliberations are framed with rational ideas and methodologies.
Muniversiti has collaborations with dozens of NGO partners, has conducted
20+ conferences, trained and catered to 40.000+ students. Muniversiti’s
conferences remain unique because we pass down the resolutions prepared
by delegates in each conference to our partnering NGOs, who possess the
skills and resources required to implement those solutions. We associate
with people working in fields ranging from gender equality to climate change
in order to ensure none of the ideas proposed by the youth goes in vain.

<br><br>

Muniversiti has had the opportunity to connect with 75,000+ students
through orientations throughout the years. A total of 5000+ attendees and
150+ institutions have been engaged with the conference thus far. It has
always been the goal of Indore World Summit to help students feel the true
fervour of being a diplomat and have an unparalleled experience of MUN. On
top of that, the conference is known for the high calibre of its speakers and
participants, who come together for three days to not only share ideas and
opinions, but also to network and gain knowledge from their peers from
different institutions. Additionally, the conference is well-known for its highquality educational modules, which are specifically designed to enhance the
delegate's overall experience. 

<br><br>

The Indore World Summit 2022 intends to smash all barriers and
welcome the delegates back with a bang following a lengthy
covid break. Muniversiti expects to host over a 1,000+ delegates
this year, drawing on the resources of more than 100 institutions
PAN India and providing orientations for more than 20,000 new
students. At a state-of-the-art location, the
conference will give delegates with the greatest possible learning experience.

The allocated nation neither affects speaking time in committees nor gives certain delegates an edge over others in terms of recognition.  When deciding to which country to assign to a delegate, the application quality is the most crucial criteria.

          <h4>It was the best experience!</h4>
        <p>“ The Indore World Summit was the largest conference that I was able to attend. There were over 1200 participants there, and they came from some of the nation's most prestigious ihgh schools. IWS gives students with the chance to learn how to interact with others and find a way to work together from varied perspectives to reach an agreement, which is another reason why I loved the confernce. To be able to put oneself in the position of another person is a challenging task, but I feel that mastering this skill is exactly what the world needs right now. ”</p>

        <p>“ IWS Mun has provided me with some of the most rewarding opportunities that I have ever had in my life. It is simply so amazing, and it educated me on a lot of other subjects. My very first Model United Nations session was the IWS 2019 conference, and it blew my mind! The events are extraordinarily well-organized, and the memories you make during them are invaluable. The whole concept of the IWS really ignited a passion in me to pursue diplomacy in my future. It provides a great platform to exhibit our qualities and polish them to become a better version of ourselves! I am glad to be a part of this journey! ”</p>

        <p>“ The Indore World Summit was the Biggest conference that I was able to attend. There were over 1200 participants there, and they came from some of the nation's most prestigious high schools. IWS gives students with the chance to learn how to interact with others and find a way to work together from varied perspectives to reach an agreement, which is another reason why I loved the conference. To be able to put oneself in the position of another person is a challenging task, but I feel that mastering this skill is exactly what the world needs right now.”</p>
